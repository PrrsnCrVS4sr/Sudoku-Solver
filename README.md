# Sudoku Solver 


### Note:
Model hasn't been trained on MNIST, as most of the digits in Sudoku puzzles are in printed format. The images of the digits can be found in digits folder, which was downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kshitijdhama/printed-digits-dataset?resource=download
This was then converted into Numpy arrays, using a loader, which isn't included in this repo. Feel free to use your own dataset and models.
### Bugs:
Still lot of work is to be done.
Extracting the digit isn't exactly perfect at this moment.
Corrections, have to be applied whenever digits aren't properly recognized.
